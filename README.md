A collection of my individual and collaborative projects.

### 1) **Popularity Score of Music Tracks**. (https://github.com/gretakichelmacher/Popularity-Score-of-a-Music-Tracks.-ML-Project) 
   This is a LUISS University team project made in the Machine Learning Course. The objective of this project was to perform an in-depth analysis of the factors influencing a music track's popularity. Extensive use of Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn and Matplotlib for data analysis and ML libraries such as Scikit learn and XGB classifier.

### 2) **Estimating Corporate Bond Liquidity Score**.
This is a LUISS University team project made in the Data Science in Action Course, in collaboration with Banca ICCREA. The project's objective was to create a regression model capable of precisely forecasting the Liquidity Score of corporate bonds. This effort centered on predicting the Liquidity Score as assessed by Bloomberg, which varies from 1 to 100. The ultimate dataset used for this model was formed by combining three separate data subsets, all sourced from Bloomberg. Extensive use of Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn and Matplotlib for data analysis and ML libraries such as Scikit learn, XGB classifier and torch.

### 3) **Predicting Diabetes**.
This is a personal project. This analysis aims to determine if an individual has diabetes or not, which constitutes a binary classification task. In the context of medical diagnoses, attention must be equally distributed between recall and precision as both are crucial metrics (Lu et al., 2020). However, the repercussions of overlooking a true positive—failing to diagnose a diabetic person—are significantly more severe than false positives. Missing a diabetic diagnosis means delayed treatment, with potentially dire health implications. Consequently, the analysis prioritizes both the F1-score, which balances precision and recall, and particularly emphasizes recall to mitigate the risks of non-detection of diabetes (Assiri et al., 2020). Extensive use of Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn and Matplotlib for data analysis and ML libraries such as Scikit learn and Imbalanced Learn to deal with the imbalanced dataset (SMOTE, SMOTEEN).
