### 1) **Popularity Score of Music Tracks**. (https://github.com/gretakichelmacher/Popularity-Score-of-a-Music-Tracks.-ML-Project) 
   This is a LUISS University team project made in the Machine Learning Course. The objective of this project was to perform an in-depth analysis of the factors influencing a music track's popularity. Extensive use of Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn and Matplot for data analysis and ML libraries such as Scikit learn and XGB classifier.

### 2) **Estimating Corporate Bond Liquidity Score**.
This is a LUISS University team project made in the Data Science in Action Course, in collaboration with Banca ICCREA. The project's objective was to create a regression model capable of precisely forecasting the Liquidity Score of corporate bonds. This effort centered on predicting the Liquidity Score as assessed by Bloomberg, which varies from 1 to 100. The ultimate dataset used for this model was formed by combining three separate data subsets, all sourced from Bloomberg. Extensive use of Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn and Matplot for data analysis and ML libraries such as Scikit learn and XGB classifier.
